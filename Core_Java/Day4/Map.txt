Map:
----

It is not a child of Collection interface

It is created by combining List and Set Families.


 1) If we want to represent a group of objects as “key-value” pair then we should go for 
Map interface. 
2) Both key and value are objects only. 
3) Duplicate keys are not allowed but values can be duplicated. 
4) Each key-value pair is called “one entry”.


 put(k,v);

 k,v = entry

key column uses Set family features
value column uses List family features

methods:

put(k,v)  --> add key,value in map

remove(k) --> remove element for given key

get(k) ---> returns value for given key


keySet(); ---> return Set which gives set of keys

values(); ---> return Collection which gives set of values
