Abstraction:  Highlighting set of services to the user and Hiding implementation code.


Abstraction can be achieved by using inteface , abstract classes or implementation classes


Interface:
----------
End User: It is a medium to access set of services using UI(User Interface).

Developer: It is a specification or requirement (set of services) which need to be implement 
			by the developers.


interface:
----------
interface can be created using "interface" keyword
it does not has any constructor (objects cannot be created)
it is also known as pure abstract class.




abstract class:
-----------------

Abstract class is a java class which can have abstract methods as well as non-abstract methods
We cannot create object for abstract classes  (but they will have constructors)

We can use abstract class concept when we want to do partial implementation to any interface.
OR
We can use abstract class concept when we dont want someone to create object of our class.

It is also used  in implementation of Abstraction concept in Java




public interface IBank {



	public  default  void userLogin(){

		// user login logics here

	}

	public static void   openAccountForm(){

		// new account form
	}

		
	public void withdraw();
	public void deposit();
	public  void  checkBalance();


}


class BankImp  implements IBank{  // shivam



	public void withdraw(){

	IBank bank =	new BankImp();		
		bank.userLogin();

		// withdraw logics
	}


}



clas Test{



	main(){

		IBank.openAccountForm();	


	}
